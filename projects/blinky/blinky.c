 * description:
 *    Blinks 1 on-board LED at roughly 1 second intervals.
 *    system clock is running from HSI which is 16 Mhz.
 *    Delay function is just a simple counter so is not
 *    accurate and the delay time will change based on the
 *    optimization flags.
 *
 * gpio setup steps:
 *   There are at least three steps associated with GPIO:
 *   1. enable GPIOx clock from RCC
 *   2. set the direction of the pins from MODER (input / output)
 *   3. (optional) set the speed of the pins from OSPEEDR
 *   4. (optional) set pins to pull-up or pull-down or
 *         leave them floating from PUPDR
 *   5. (optional) set output type register to push-pull or
 *         open-drain from OTYPER
 *   6. either read from IDR or write to ODR depending on
 *         input or output configuration

    // of the code, we need to make sure it is cleared before writing it.
